                    <h2>Lead Organizer, 3 Day Startup Austin </h2>
                    <p>3 Day Startup is a hands-on entreprenuership program where students come together and found companies over a frantic 72 hours.  I first took part in the program in 2014, and from 2014 to 2016 I joined the program as a lead organizer.  To read about my participation experience, read the Never Empty blurb below.  As lead organizer I recruited, interviewed, and evaluated potential participants while also doing some fundraising.</p>

                <h2>Never Empty: 3 Day Startup Company</h2>
                <p>During Fall 2014, four others and I created Never Empty: a gasoline delivery company.  The idea was to partner with companies to provide their employees with gas refills in company parking lots.  After 3 Day Startup, we entered our business plan into the Texas Venture Labs Investment Competition where we were semifinalists.  We pursued the idea for some time afterward, but ultimately the idea was put on hold indefinitely.</p>
